Community Graph Discovery
    streamlit or react application
    dockerize for jade deployment
    data manipulation
        database? polars? etc?
        file types? arrow, parquet, etc?
    modular design - analytic itself encapsulated within the container    


Project Outline (POAM without)

Software Architecture analysis and selection
    Establish datatypes, inputs outs etc between software components ()
    
Requirements Elicitation


(so that the application itself is modular, 
just swap out app.py for new analytics)

- MVP parameters
- additional features
- definition of done

Quality attributes and metrics

Software Design
class, activity, state diagrams etc.

    Analytic
        Community Discovery
        hyper-parameter tuning 
            - edge weights etc
            feature vector definitions
        community categorization
            - enriching data to accomplish this
            
        

    Software features
        algorithm selection
        edge and node selection
        feature vector manipulation
            ability to input formula or relationships to create novel weighting on the fly
            
        community view
            in isolation
        interloquetor view
    
        

edge and node manipulation 
    - able to change between as well as some feature engineering
    scalable, invertable edge and node weighting - combinable and scalable



visualizations
    pyvis

UI
    streamlit

additional network plotting layouts
    dual bipartite?
